      <h2>Currently ramping up on AI Coding</h2>

      <h3>I love to learn - and want to catch up quickly on what I can do with my coding background and available open source AI tools</h3>
      
      <h3>Step 1 - Build Local AI Development Environment</h3>
      <p>* For a local AI coding playground got a GMKtec mini PC - <a href='https://www.gmktec.com/products/amd-ryzen%E2%84%A2-ai-9-hx-370-evo-x1-ai-mini-pc'>the EVO-X1</a>. Features the AMD Ryzen Al 9 HX 370 as a CPU and the Radeon 890M GPU</p>
      <p>* Installed Ubuntu 24.04 as dual boot</p>
      <p>* Installed Docker and Docker image released from AMD for Pytorch with ROCm support - required to leverage the GPU for faster processing</a></p>

      <h3>Step 2 - Pick a project</h3>
      <p>I'm interested in learning more about document parsing automation. What I have seen in the healthcare industry is a lot of documents requiring people to enter and re-enter data. Big opportunity for automation!</p>
      <p> Wouldn't it be cool to automate a lot of that work? To learn more about what is possible today leveraging AI, I am choosing to start in an area where I suspect a lot of document parsing work has been done - RESUMES. Seems like a good project becasue hopefully iy is bite sized and achievable and will require on a lot of different AI tools.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 - leverage and learn about how I can use AI to speed my learning</h3>
      <p>One aspect I want to learn about is using AI to augment/help with coding. So I started with a prompt using ChatGPT - which I am somewhat familair with: "Kindly write me python code that will download a PDF resume from google drive and use pytorch libraries to parse and save the document into the JSON Resume format.</p>
      <p>From that simple request, not only does chat GPT write code, but it suggests the specific python libraries that I will need to install and even instructions on the installation of the libraries. All in simple plain and friendly english and clean code. Hey this is fun - and I am blown away. It takes some time to install the libraries, manage the code in github, and clone the repository down to my local development environment. But I run it and what do I find? bugs of course. But to debug I simnply copy and paste the debugging messages to chat gpt - or ask it about issues I am running into and chat gpt then suggests changes to its own code and rewrites it. Mind BLOWN</p>
      <p>My script - (or its script? who actually owns the copyright with this iterative collaboration? Man. We are on a frontier.) I'll call it OUR script finally gets to the point where I am producing output. But looking at the JSON, the script is failing to parse the data into correct fields. I ask Chat GPT the following:</p>

      <p>This is an OCR script that reads a resume and parses it to JSON. The issue is that there is no AI to interpret the context of each piece of data to parse it correctly. Can you recommend a pytorch library that can do that and alter the code so that it parses the resume correctly?</p>

      <p>ChatGPT: "You're spot on — raw OCR text doesn't understand context like “this line is a job title” or “this is an education section.” To improve this, you can use a layout-aware language model trained on document understanding, ideally one that works well with resumes."</p>

      <p>AND OF COURSE! So down the rabbit hole I go - first having ChatGPT rewrite the scrit to implent a layout-aware large language model and then providing training data for resumes and then fine tuning the training data.....so I will learn about the training and labeling....What a perfect learning starting point this project is prving to be. Stoked at how quickly one can learn with ChatGPT. This would have been days of coding and research!</p>
